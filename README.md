# Parametric NTT/INTT Hardware

This repository provides the baseline version of Verilog code for parametric NTT/INTT hardware published in "<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9171507">An Extensive Study of Flexible Design Methods for the Number Theoretic Transform</a>".

You have to set three parameters defined in `defines.v`:

Other versions of the hardware generator and documentation will be available soon.
